# **Overview of Software Engineering**

## **What is Software Engineering?**

### <ins>Software engineering defined</ins>
- Software engineering involves the application of scientific principles to design and create software. It follows a systematic approach to gather and analyze business requirements, enabling the development, construction, and testing of software applications that meet those requirements effectively.

- As computing emerged in the late 1950s, software engineering was a relatively undefined discipline. However, it has progressively evolved into a modernized engineering field.

- During the 1960s, software engineering emerged as a distinct discipline and underwent significant transformation as new technologies were introduced, making it more scientifically oriented. Consequently, the trends in software engineering shifted from ad hoc programming practices to more formal and standardized methods.

### <ins>Software crisis</ins>
- In the early stages, software creation lacked a standardized development process. However, as computers gained widespread adoption, software became increasingly indispensable in various domains. Unfortunately, the inherent inefficiencies of the software development process presented significant challenges in meeting the rapidly growing demand for computing resources and complex software. This led to the emergence of the 'Software Crisis' in the mid-1960s, lasting until the mid-1980s. 

- During this period, software development frequently encountered issues such as exceeding budget limits, falling behind schedule, and dealing with unmanageable, bug-ridden code. Many organizations had to resort to complete system redesigns to address these challenges. Moreover, approaches that proved effective for smaller software systems often proved inadequate when applied to larger, more intricate projects. 

- By the time older software solutions were completed, newer, superior technologies had already been developed, forcing software engineers to refactor or completely redesign their systems. Often, solutions that worked for small software systems failed to scale up to large, complex projects.

- While some of the previously mentioned issues still persist today, their impact has significantly diminished thanks to the consistent application of engineering principles in the software development process. The availability of computing resources has expanded, and standardized methodologies for software development now enable the creation of scalable, large-scale solutions for complex problems

- The resolution to the "Software Crisis" entailed the transformation of ad hoc coding endeavors into a formalized engineering discipline. Additionally, the mid-1980s witnessed the emergence and proliferation of computer-aided software engineering (CASE) tools, which played a significant role in alleviating the challenges posed by the software crisis.

- CASE tools encompass a diverse range of functionalities and can be classified into six distinct categories:
    - Business analysis and modeling: These tools facilitate the analysis and modeling of business processes, enabling a deeper understanding of requirements and aiding in effective software design.

    - Development tools: This category includes tools that assist in software development tasks, such as debugging environments that streamline the process of identifying and rectifying code errors, ensuring the creation of robust and reliable software.

    - Verification and validation tools: These tools are designed to validate and verify the functionality, performance, and quality of the software being developed. They help identify and address potential defects, ensuring that the final product meets the desired specifications.

    - Configuration management: Tools in this category assist in managing and controlling software configurations, including version control, change tracking, and release management. They enable efficient collaboration among team members and ensure proper organization and tracking of software components.

    - Metrics and measurement: These tools provide quantitative insights into various aspects of the software development process, such as code complexity, test coverage, and productivity metrics. They help in evaluating and improving the efficiency and quality of the software being developed.

    - Project management: Tools in this category aid in planning, organizing, and tracking software development projects. They facilitate tasks such as resource allocation, scheduling, task management, and progress monitoring, enhancing overall project efficiency and ensuring timely delivery.

### <ins>Software engineer vs software developer</ins>
- The term "software engineer" is often used interchangeably with software developer, but there are subtle differences.

    - While software engineers are also developers, the term "software developer" typically implies a narrower focus compared to that of a software engineer.

    - Software engineers possess a broader range of knowledge and typically take a systematic, big-picture approach to software development, whereas developers may exhibit more creativity in their approaches.

    - Both software engineers and software developers possess specialized knowledge, but software engineers apply that knowledge to construct entire systems, whereas software developers utilize their knowledge to write code and implement specific functionality within a system.

    - Software engineers are commonly involved in large-scale projects, with their focus centered on designing the overall structure rather than solving immediate problems.

### <ins>Software engineer responsibilities</ins>
- Software engineers are responsible for the design, construction, and maintenance of software systems. Their diverse range of responsibilities includes:

    - Writing and thoroughly testing code to ensure its functionality and reliability.

    - Collaborating with stakeholders, such as clients, third-party software vendors, security specialists, and fellow team members, to gather requirements and address any concerns or challenges.

### <ins>Software development life cycle (SDLC)</ins>
- The adoption of a systematic, scientific approach to software development has profoundly impacted the creation and design of software. In modern times, the development process is commonly guided by the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC), which outlines the necessary steps to ensure the development of high-quality software.
