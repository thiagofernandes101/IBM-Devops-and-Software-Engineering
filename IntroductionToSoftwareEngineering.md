# **Overview of Software Engineering**

## **What is Software Engineering?**

### <ins>Software engineering defined</ins>
- Software engineering involves the application of scientific principles to design and create software. It follows a systematic approach to gather and analyze business requirements, enabling the development, construction, and testing of software applications that meet those requirements effectively.

- As computing emerged in the late 1950s, software engineering was a relatively undefined discipline. However, it has progressively evolved into a modernized engineering field.

- During the 1960s, software engineering emerged as a distinct discipline and underwent significant transformation as new technologies were introduced, making it more scientifically oriented. Consequently, the trends in software engineering shifted from ad hoc programming practices to more formal and standardized methods.

### <ins>Software crisis</ins>
- In the early stages, software creation lacked a standardized development process. However, as computers gained widespread adoption, software became increasingly indispensable in various domains. Unfortunately, the inherent inefficiencies of the software development process presented significant challenges in meeting the rapidly growing demand for computing resources and complex software. This led to the emergence of the 'Software Crisis' in the mid-1960s, lasting until the mid-1980s. 

- During this period, software development frequently encountered issues such as exceeding budget limits, falling behind schedule, and dealing with unmanageable, bug-ridden code. Many organizations had to resort to complete system redesigns to address these challenges. Moreover, approaches that proved effective for smaller software systems often proved inadequate when applied to larger, more intricate projects. 

- By the time older software solutions were completed, newer, superior technologies had already been developed, forcing software engineers to refactor or completely redesign their systems. Often, solutions that worked for small software systems failed to scale up to large, complex projects.

- While some of the previously mentioned issues still persist today, their impact has significantly diminished thanks to the consistent application of engineering principles in the software development process. The availability of computing resources has expanded, and standardized methodologies for software development now enable the creation of scalable, large-scale solutions for complex problems

- The resolution to the "Software Crisis" entailed the transformation of ad hoc coding endeavors into a formalized engineering discipline. Additionally, the mid-1980s witnessed the emergence and proliferation of computer-aided software engineering (CASE) tools, which played a significant role in alleviating the challenges posed by the software crisis.

- CASE tools encompass a diverse range of functionalities and can be classified into six distinct categories:
    - Business analysis and modeling: These tools facilitate the analysis and modeling of business processes, enabling a deeper understanding of requirements and aiding in effective software design.

    - Development tools: This category includes tools that assist in software development tasks, such as debugging environments that streamline the process of identifying and rectifying code errors, ensuring the creation of robust and reliable software.

    - Verification and validation tools: These tools are designed to validate and verify the functionality, performance, and quality of the software being developed. They help identify and address potential defects, ensuring that the final product meets the desired specifications.

    - Configuration management: Tools in this category assist in managing and controlling software configurations, including version control, change tracking, and release management. They enable efficient collaboration among team members and ensure proper organization and tracking of software components.

    - Metrics and measurement: These tools provide quantitative insights into various aspects of the software development process, such as code complexity, test coverage, and productivity metrics. They help in evaluating and improving the efficiency and quality of the software being developed.

    - Project management: Tools in this category aid in planning, organizing, and tracking software development projects. They facilitate tasks such as resource allocation, scheduling, task management, and progress monitoring, enhancing overall project efficiency and ensuring timely delivery.

### <ins>Software engineer vs software developer</ins>
- The term "software engineer" is often used interchangeably with software developer, but there are subtle differences.

    - While software engineers are also developers, the term "software developer" typically implies a narrower focus compared to that of a software engineer.

    - Software engineers possess a broader range of knowledge and typically take a systematic, big-picture approach to software development, whereas developers may exhibit more creativity in their approaches.

    - Both software engineers and software developers possess specialized knowledge, but software engineers apply that knowledge to construct entire systems, whereas software developers utilize their knowledge to write code and implement specific functionality within a system.

    - Software engineers are commonly involved in large-scale projects, with their focus centered on designing the overall structure rather than solving immediate problems.

### <ins>Software engineer responsibilities</ins>
- Software engineers are responsible for the design, construction, and maintenance of software systems. Their diverse range of responsibilities includes:

    - Writing and thoroughly testing code to ensure its functionality and reliability.

    - Collaborating with stakeholders, such as clients, third-party software vendors, security specialists, and fellow team members, to gather requirements and address any concerns or challenges.

### <ins>Software development life cycle (SDLC)</ins>
- The adoption of a systematic, scientific approach to software development has profoundly impacted the creation and design of software. In modern times, the development process is commonly guided by the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC), which outlines the necessary steps to ensure the development of high-quality software.

## **Introduction the the SDLC**

### <ins>Software development life cycle (SDLC)</ins>
- The Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) is a systematic approach to developing high-quality software within defined timeframes and budgets, with the ultimate goal of meeting a client's specific business requirements.

- The SDLC establishes distinct phases in the software development process, each with its own set of processes and deliverables. It follows a cyclical pattern of planning, design, and development, which can be implemented iteratively to enhance the software development process.

- By adhering to the SDLC, organizations can mitigate risks and control costs associated with the development of deployable, high-quality software. It provides a structured framework that ensures efficient collaboration, thorough testing, and successful delivery of software solutions.

### <ins>History of the SDLC</ins>
- The emergence of the software development life cycle (SDLC) gained momentum in the mid-1960s, driven by the increasing complexity of software development and the need for a more structured approach.

- As large corporations sought to manage intricate business systems that demanded substantial computational resources, the SDLC provided a deliberate and systematic approach to address these challenges.

- Initially, the SDLC relied on the "waterfall method," a linear approach that guided software development through distinct stages. However, in response to evolving customer needs and changing requirements, the SDLC has since been adapted to incorporate more iterative and flexible methodologies.

- This evolution reflects a shift towards more customer-centric development practices, allowing for continuous feedback and adjustment throughout the software development process. The SDLC has embraced iterative methods to enhance responsiveness and better align software solutions with customer expectations.

### <ins>Advantages of the SDLC</ins>
- There are some key advantages for business following the SDLC.

    1. Improved Efficiency and Risk Reduction: The SDLC provides development teams with a structured process to follow, replacing ad hoc approaches. This enhances efficiency, minimizes errors, and reduces risks associated with software development.

    2. Clear and Well-Defined Phases: The SDLC breaks down the development process into distinct phases, ensuring that team members understand their tasks and deadlines. This facilitates effective communication among customers, stakeholders, and the development team, fostering collaboration and alignment throughout the project.

    3. Enhanced Stakeholder Engagement: The SDLC offers an overview of the entire process, enabling stakeholders to understand their role within it. Each phase's clear boundaries help cross-domain teams determine when they have completed their tasks and when development can progress to the next phase, ensuring timely collaboration and coordinated efforts.

    4. Iterative Approach and Adaptability: The SDLC accommodates iterations, allowing for the incorporation of additional requirements and changes as needed. At the end of a cycle, the process can circle back to address new insights or evolving business needs, resulting in more flexible and adaptable software solutions.

    5. Early Problem Solving: The SDLC incorporates problem-solving early in the cycle. This enables issues to be identified and addressed during the design phase rather than during coding, leading to more efficient problem resolution and preventing potential setbacks later in the development process.

    6. Defined Roles and Reduced Conflicts: Each team member has a well-defined role within the SDLC, reducing conflicts and overlapping responsibilities. This clarity fosters a smoother workflow, improved collaboration, and better overall team dynamics.
