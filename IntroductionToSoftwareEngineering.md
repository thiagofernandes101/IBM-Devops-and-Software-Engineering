# **Overview of Software Engineering**

## **What is Software Engineering?**

### <ins>Software engineering defined</ins>
- Software engineering involves the application of scientific principles to design and create software. It follows a systematic approach to gather and analyze business requirements, enabling the development, construction, and testing of software applications that meet those requirements effectively.

- As computing emerged in the late 1950s, software engineering was a relatively undefined discipline. However, it has progressively evolved into a modernized engineering field.

- During the 1960s, software engineering emerged as a distinct discipline and underwent significant transformation as new technologies were introduced, making it more scientifically oriented. Consequently, the trends in software engineering shifted from ad hoc programming practices to more formal and standardized methods.

### <ins>Software crisis</ins>
- In the early stages, software creation lacked a standardized development process. However, as computers gained widespread adoption, software became increasingly indispensable in various domains. Unfortunately, the inherent inefficiencies of the software development process presented significant challenges in meeting the rapidly growing demand for computing resources and complex software. This led to the emergence of the 'Software Crisis' in the mid-1960s, lasting until the mid-1980s. 

- During this period, software development frequently encountered issues such as exceeding budget limits, falling behind schedule, and dealing with unmanageable, bug-ridden code. Many organizations had to resort to complete system redesigns to address these challenges. Moreover, approaches that proved effective for smaller software systems often proved inadequate when applied to larger, more intricate projects. 

- By the time older software solutions were completed, newer, superior technologies had already been developed, forcing software engineers to refactor or completely redesign their systems. Often, solutions that worked for small software systems failed to scale up to large, complex projects.

- While some of the previously mentioned issues still persist today, their impact has significantly diminished thanks to the consistent application of engineering principles in the software development process. The availability of computing resources has expanded, and standardized methodologies for software development now enable the creation of scalable, large-scale solutions for complex problems

- The resolution to the "Software Crisis" entailed the transformation of ad hoc coding endeavors into a formalized engineering discipline. Additionally, the mid-1980s witnessed the emergence and proliferation of computer-aided software engineering (CASE) tools, which played a significant role in alleviating the challenges posed by the software crisis.

- CASE tools encompass a diverse range of functionalities and can be classified into six distinct categories:
    - Business analysis and modeling: These tools facilitate the analysis and modeling of business processes, enabling a deeper understanding of requirements and aiding in effective software design.

    - Development tools: This category includes tools that assist in software development tasks, such as debugging environments that streamline the process of identifying and rectifying code errors, ensuring the creation of robust and reliable software.

    - Verification and validation tools: These tools are designed to validate and verify the functionality, performance, and quality of the software being developed. They help identify and address potential defects, ensuring that the final product meets the desired specifications.

    - Configuration management: Tools in this category assist in managing and controlling software configurations, including version control, change tracking, and release management. They enable efficient collaboration among team members and ensure proper organization and tracking of software components.

    - Metrics and measurement: These tools provide quantitative insights into various aspects of the software development process, such as code complexity, test coverage, and productivity metrics. They help in evaluating and improving the efficiency and quality of the software being developed.

    - Project management: Tools in this category aid in planning, organizing, and tracking software development projects. They facilitate tasks such as resource allocation, scheduling, task management, and progress monitoring, enhancing overall project efficiency and ensuring timely delivery.

### <ins>Software engineer vs software developer</ins>
- The term "software engineer" is often used interchangeably with software developer, but there are subtle differences.

    - While software engineers are also developers, the term "software developer" typically implies a narrower focus compared to that of a software engineer.

    - Software engineers possess a broader range of knowledge and typically take a systematic, big-picture approach to software development, whereas developers may exhibit more creativity in their approaches.

    - Both software engineers and software developers possess specialized knowledge, but software engineers apply that knowledge to construct entire systems, whereas software developers utilize their knowledge to write code and implement specific functionality within a system.

    - Software engineers are commonly involved in large-scale projects, with their focus centered on designing the overall structure rather than solving immediate problems.

### <ins>Software engineer responsibilities</ins>

    5. Early Problem Solving: The SDLC incorporates problem-solving early in the cycle. This enables issues to be identified and addressed during the design phase rather than during coding, leading to more efficient problem resolution and preventing potential setbacks later in the development process.

    6. Defined Roles and Reduced Conflicts: Each team member has a well-defined role within the SDLC, reducing conflicts and overlapping responsibilities. This clarity fosters a smoother workflow, improved collaboration, and better overall team dynamics.

## **Phases of the SDLC**

### <ins>SDLC phases</ins>
- The Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) typically consists of six phases, providing a structured approach to software development:

    1. Planning: This phase involves gathering requirements, defining project goals, establishing timelines, and allocating resources. It sets the foundation for the entire development process.

    2. Design: In this phase, the software's architecture, components, and user interface are designed. It includes creating system specifications, wireframes, and prototypes to visualize the software's structure and functionality.

    3. Development: The development phase involves writing code based on the design specifications. Programmers implement the software's features and functionality, following coding standards and best practices.

    4. Testing: During the testing phase, the software is rigorously tested to identify and rectify any bugs, errors, or inconsistencies. Various testing methods, such as unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing, are employed to ensure the software meets quality standards.

    5. Deployment: Once the software passes the testing phase, it is deployed or released to the production environment. This includes installation, configuration, and making the software available to end-users.

    6. Maintenance: The maintenance phase involves ongoing support, bug fixes, updates, and enhancements throughout the software's lifecycle. It ensures the software remains reliable, secure, and compatible with evolving technologies and user needs.

- Each phase is discrete. This means that tasks from a previous phase do not overlap with tasks in the next phase.

- While the original SDLC followed a linear waterfall method, the approach has evolved to introduce iterations. This allows for the accommodation of shifting requirements and promotes a more flexible and adaptable development process.

- It's worth noting that different organizations may use alternative names for each stage. For example, "planning" may be referred to as "requirements gathering," "strategy," or "analysis." Additionally, organizations may have additional or fewer stages depending on their specific development processes and methodologies.

### <ins>Phase 1: Planning</ins>
- The planning phase of the SDLC is crucial for gathering, analyzing, documenting, and prioritizing requirements.

- During this phase, several factors need to be considered to ensure a successful software solution:

    - Users of the solution: Understanding the target audience and their specific needs and preferences.

    - The overall purpose of the solution: Defining the primary objectives and goals of the software solution.

    - Data inputs and outputs: Identifying the data sources and desired outputs of the software.

    - Project scheduling: Developing a timeline and milestones for the project.

- In addition to planning the above factors, the planning phase involves estimating labor and material costs, considering time constraints, and identifying project teams and their respective roles.

- Prototyping is often employed during the planning stage to help stakeholders define requirements.

> NOTE: A prototype is a small-scale replica of the end product used to get stakeholder feedback and establish requirements and is used to test basic design ideas. Though prototyping usually occurs during the planning stage, prototyping can occur at various phases of the SDLC whenever requirements need to be reconsidered or clarified as the project develops.

- Once the requirements have been gathered, they are consolidated into a comprehensive document known as the "Software Requirements Specification" (SRS). This document serves as a clear and approved understanding of the requirements for all stakeholders. Developers are actively involved at this stage to gain a thorough understanding of the requirements and align their development approach accordingly.

### <ins>Phase 2: Design</ins>
- During the design phase, the requirements gathered from the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) are utilized to develop the software architecture. In this stage, a collaborative effort among team members takes place to design the architecture, which is subsequently reviewed by both stakeholders and the team.

- Prototypes can be created in this phase to serve as demonstrations, and a design document is generated. This document, known as the design document, serves as a reference for developers throughout the development phase.

### <ins>Phase 3: Development</ins>
- The development phase, also known as the "building" or "implementation" phase, marks the commencement of the coding process once the design document has been finalized. During this phase, the project planner refers to the design document to allocate and assign coding tasks, which often involve the utilization of programming tools, various programming languages, and software stacks. It is common for organizations to have specific standards or guidelines that developers must adhere to.

### <ins>Phase 4: Testing</ins>
- The testing phase follows the completion of coding and can take the form of manual testing, automated testing, or a combination of both. During this phase, product bugs are identified, logged, tracked, and subsequently resolved. This iterative process continues until the software achieves stability.

- For larger projects, dedicated testing teams are often employed to conduct comprehensive testing. This is crucial to ensure that the code is thoroughly tested for stability, security, and compliance with the requirements specified in the Software Requirements Specification (SRS).

- Several levels of testing are commonly employed, including unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing. Each level serves its specific purpose in ensuring the quality and reliability of the software.

### <ins>Phase 5: Deployment</ins>
- The deployment phase marks the release of the application into the production environment, making it accessible to users.

- The deployment process may occur in stages. Initially, the application is deployed onto a user acceptance testing (UAT) platform, where the functionality is thoroughly evaluated. Once the customer approves the functionality, the application is then released to the production environment. This approach is commonly employed for making software available on websites, mobile app stores, or software distribution servers within corporate networks.

- By following this staged deployment approach, organizations can ensure a smooth and controlled transition of the software into the hands of users while minimizing potential disruptions or issues

### <ins>Phase 6: Maintenance</ins>
- The maintenance phase occurs after the code has been deployed to the production environment.

- During this phase, the primary objective is to identify and address any remaining bugs or issues that may have been overlooked during testing. It also involves evaluating user interface (UI) issues and identifying additional requirements that were not initially specified in the Software Requirements Specification (SRS). Furthermore, code enhancements may be implemented to improve the software's functionality and performance.

    - Eliciting Requirements: Eliciting requirements involves gathering information from stakeholders to identify their needs, preferences, and expectations. This can be achieved through various techniques, such as surveys, questionnaires, interviews, and workshops. The goal is to extract relevant information and capture the requirements in a comprehensive manner.

    -  Documenting Requirements: Once the requirements are elicited, it is important to document them in a clear and understandable manner. The requirements documentation should provide a detailed description of the functionality, features, and constraints of the software. It should be organized, structured, and accessible to stakeholders and the project team. Various documentation formats can be used, such as textual requirements, use cases, user stories, diagrams, and prototypes, depending on the project's needs.

    - Confirming Requirements: Confirming the requirements involves analyzing and evaluating them to ensure consistency, clarity, and completeness. This step helps identify any gaps, conflicts, or ambiguities in the requirements. Requirements should be reviewed and validated by stakeholders and subject matter experts to verify their accuracy and relevance. This confirmation process helps minimize misunderstandings and ensures that the documented requirements accurately represent the stakeholders' needs and expectations.

    - Sharing with Approved Stakeholders: Once the requirements have been confirmed, they should be shared with the approved stakeholders for their review and approval. This step ensures that all relevant parties have visibility into the requirements and can provide feedback or make necessary revisions. Effective communication and collaboration with stakeholders are key to ensuring that the requirements are well-understood and aligned with the project's goals.

- It is important to note that the requirement gathering process is iterative, meaning that these steps may be repeated multiple times throughout the project lifecycle. As the project progresses and stakeholders gain a deeper understanding of the requirements, new insights may emerge, requiring adjustments to the elicited, documented, and confirmed requirements.

### <ins>Prioritizing</ins>
- Once the requirements have been confirmed, it is important to prioritize them to ensure that the most critical and valuable features are addressed first. Prioritization helps in resource allocation, decision-making, and determining the order in which the requirements should be implemented. Here are some key steps in prioritizing requirements:

    - Categorize the Requirements: Start by categorizing the requirements into different groups based on their importance and urgency. Common labels used for categorization include "must-have," "high-priority," "medium-priority," and "nice-to-have." These labels provide a clear understanding of the relative importance of each requirement.

    - Consider Business Value: Assess the business value of each requirement by considering its impact on achieving the project's goals and objectives. Identify requirements that directly contribute to the project's success, such as those that address critical user needs, improve efficiency, or provide a competitive advantage.

    - Evaluate Dependencies: Consider dependencies between requirements and determine whether certain requirements need to be addressed before others. Some requirements may rely on the completion of specific prerequisites or the availability of certain resources. Prioritizing requirements with dependencies in mind helps ensure a logical and efficient development process.

    -  Engage Stakeholders: Involve stakeholders in the prioritization process to gather their input and perspectives. This can be done through meetings, workshops, or surveys. Seek feedback from stakeholders to understand their priorities, expectations, and any potential trade-offs that need to be considered.

    - Apply Agile Principles: If following an Agile development approach, consider using techniques such as MoSCoW (Must-have, Should-have, Could-have, Won't-have) or relative prioritization methods like the Weighted Shortest Job First (WSJF) technique. These methods assign a priority value or weight to each requirement, enabling a more precise prioritization process.

    -  Regularly Review and Adjust: Prioritization is not a one-time activity. It should be an ongoing process throughout the project lifecycle. As the project progresses and new information becomes available, regularly review and adjust the prioritization of requirements to ensure alignment with changing project needs and stakeholder expectations.

### <ins>Requirements documentation</ins>
- During the requirements gathering process, it is common to create multiple documents to capture and communicate the gathered requirements. These documents help provide a clear understanding of the software requirements and serve as a reference for the development team. While the specific document names and formats may vary, three commonly used types of requirements documents are:

    1. Software Requirements Specification (SRS): The SRS is a comprehensive document that describes the functional and non-functional requirements of the software. It provides an overview of the software system, its features, and the interactions with users and external systems. The SRS serves as a contract between the development team and stakeholders, ensuring a shared understanding of what the software should accomplish.

    2. User Requirements Specification (URS): The URS focuses on capturing the needs and expectations of the end-users. It describes the software requirements from the perspective of the users, highlighting their goals, tasks, and desired functionalities. The URS helps ensure that the software addresses the user's requirements and provides a satisfying user experience.

    3. System Requirements Specification (SysRS): The SysRS, also known as the System Specification or Technical Requirements Document, provides detailed technical specifications and requirements for the software system. It includes information about the system architecture, hardware and software components, performance requirements, security considerations, and integration requirements. The SysRS is primarily targeted at the development team and technical stakeholders involved in the implementation of the software.

- While the System Requirements Specification (SysRS) is commonly used and focuses on technical aspects, it's important to note that the specific naming and categorization of these documents can vary between organizations and projects. Some projects may combine elements from the SRS and URS into a single document or use different terminology.

- The purpose of these documents is to document and communicate the requirements effectively, ensuring that all stakeholders have a shared understanding of what needs to be developed. They provide a basis for design, development, and testing activities throughout the software development lifecycle. Regular updates and revisions to these documents may be necessary as requirements evolve or change over time.

### <ins>Software Requirements Specification</ins>
- The Software Requirements Specification (SRS) is a crucial document that defines the functionalities and performance expectations of the software being developed. It serves as a reference for all stakeholders involved in the project, including the development team, clients, and other relevant parties. The SRS outlines various aspects of the software, ensuring a common understanding of its purpose and requirements. Here are the key components typically included in an SRS:

    - Purpose Statement: This section describes the intended use of the SRS document, including its audience and how it should be utilized throughout the software development process.

    - Scope: The scope outlines the boundaries of the software, specifying its objectives, functionalities, and any constraints that may impact the design or implementation.

    - Assumptions: Assumptions document any underlying assumptions made during the requirements gathering process. This may include assumptions about the user's hardware, operating system, or other software components required for the software to function as intended.

    - Constraints: Constraints define the limitations or conditions under which the software must operate. These can include factors such as compatibility requirements, adherence to industry standards, hardware or software dependencies, or any specific environmental considerations.

    - Dependencies: If the software relies on other software components, systems, or external interfaces, these dependencies are documented in this section. It ensures that the development team is aware of any external dependencies that need to be considered during implementation.

    - Dependencies: defines if there are dependencies on other software products.

    - Requirements: The requirements section forms the core of the SRS and can be categorized into different types:

        - Functional Requirements: These define the specific functionalities and operations that the software should perform. They describe how the software should behave and the tasks it should be able to accomplish.

        - External Interface Requirements: These requirements cover the interactions between the software and external entities, such as users, other hardware systems, or third-party software. They detail the input and output formats, communication protocols, and any data exchange requirements.

        - System Features: System features are a subset of functional requirements and highlight the essential features or capabilities that the software must possess for it to function effectively.

        - Non-functional Requirements: Non-functional requirements encompass qualities of the software that are not directly related to its functionality. They include aspects such as performance, reliability, security, usability, scalability, and other quality standards that the software should meet.

- The Software Requirements Specification serves as a contract between the stakeholders and the development team, ensuring a shared understanding of the software's requirements and objectives. It provides a foundation for subsequent phases of the software development lifecycle, including design, coding, and testing. Regular updates and revisions may be required as the project progresses and new requirements emerge or existing ones change.

### <ins>User Requirements Specification (URS)</ins>
- The User Requirements Specification (URS) is a document that focuses on capturing the business needs and expectations of the end-users from the software system. It aims to define the functional requirements from the perspective of the users and describes the desired behavior and functionalities of the software. While the URS is sometimes created as a separate document, it is common for user requirements to be included within the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document.

- Key points about the User Requirements Specification are as follows:

    - Business Needs and Expectations: The URS identifies the specific business needs that the software should address and the expectations of the end-users. It provides a clear understanding of why the software is being developed and the value it is expected to deliver.

    - User Stories or Use Cases: User requirements are often written in the form of user stories or use cases. These narratives or scenarios describe the interactions between the users and the software system, answering questions such as who the user is, what function they need to perform, and why they require that particular functionality. User stories or use cases help capture the user's perspective and define the desired behavior of the software.

    - User Acceptance Testing: User acceptance testing is a critical step in determining whether the software meets the user requirements. It involves testing the software with real end-users to ensure that it satisfies their needs, performs the expected functions, and meets their acceptance criteria. User acceptance testing validates that the software aligns with the user's expectations and is suitable for its intended purpose.

    - Integration with Software Requirements: In some cases, the user requirements and the software requirements are combined into a single Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document. This integrated approach ensures that both the business needs and the technical aspects of the software are captured and addressed in a comprehensive manner. The SRS provides a consolidated view of the expectations from both the users and the development team.

-  The URS helps establish a common understanding between the users, stakeholders, and the development team. It serves as a guide for the software development process, ensuring that the final product meets the needs and expectations of the end-users.

### <ins>System Requirements Specification (SysRS)</ins>
- The System Requirements Specification (SysRS) is a document that outlines the broader set of requirements for a software system. It provides a detailed description of the system's capabilities, interfaces, user characteristics, and other key aspects that are essential for its successful implementation and operation. While the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) focuses primarily on the functional requirements of the software, the SysRS encompasses a wider range of requirements, including hardware, performance, security, regulations, and policies.

- Key points about the System Requirements Specification are as follows:

    - System Capabilities: The SysRS defines the capabilities and functionalities of the entire system, including both the software and hardware components. It describes the expected behavior and features of the system as a whole, addressing the interactions between various subsystems and components.

    - Interfaces: The SysRS specifies the interfaces that the software system must have with external entities, such as users, other systems, databases, and hardware devices. It outlines the protocols, formats, and communication mechanisms required for seamless integration with these external interfaces.

    - User Characteristics: The SysRS identifies the characteristics and expectations of the system's users. It takes into account factors such as user roles, skill levels, accessibility requirements, and preferences to ensure that the system is designed and developed to meet their specific needs.

    - Non-functional Requirements: The SysRS includes non-functional requirements that define the quality attributes and constraints of the system. This can encompass performance requirements, security requirements, scalability, reliability, maintainability, and usability aspects. It also addresses any regulatory or policy requirements that the system must comply with.

    - Hardware Requirements: Unlike the SRS, the SysRS includes hardware requirements in addition to software requirements. It outlines the specifications and configurations of the hardware components needed to support the software system effectively. This may include details such as processing power, memory, storage, network connectivity, and other hardware dependencies.

- While the SRS focuses on the specific functionalities of the software, the SysRS provides a broader perspective, considering the system as a whole. Depending on the nature of the project, some software projects may develop an SRS instead of a separate SysRS. However, in cases where hardware components, performance, security, and other system-level factors are crucial, a dedicated SysRS helps ensure a comprehensive understanding of the system requirements.
