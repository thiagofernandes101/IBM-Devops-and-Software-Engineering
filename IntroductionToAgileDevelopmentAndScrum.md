# **Introduction to Agile Development And Scrum**

## **Introduction to agile philosophy**
### <ins>What is Agile?</ins>
- Agile is an iterative approach to project management that allows teams to be responsive and deliver value to their customers faster.

- Unlike other planning approaches where we plan out an entire year's worth of work, with Agile, we plan out small increments, and they get feedback from the customer to see if they like what we're doing. And then we adjust as we go along.

### <ins>Agile defining characteristics</ins>
- Agile emphasizes:
    
    - Adaptive planning which we don't plan out an entire year, but a small iteration to see if we can deliver something of value to the customer, get feedback and see what they like, allowing us to do evolutionary development.

    - Evolutionary development that will evolve over time. We are building... instead of building the whole thing up at once, we are building it in small increments and then evolving and responding as we go. This gives the opportunity to do early delivery.

    - Early delivery is a key component of being agile, in other words, if you are developing iterations and not delivering to the customer, you are not being agile. Putting something in the customers' hands, getting feedback from them to understand and see what they liked, should we pivot, should we persevere? This is a critical defining characteristic of being agile, over just doing iterative development.

    - Countinuous improvement is done as team. We continuously improve the product that we are delivering because we have the opportunity to get feedback from our customer, because we delivered it. This allow us to be responsive to change. So as changes happen (they always do), customers always have changing requirements. We can respond to those changes, because we haven't planned too far in advance, the customer sees the progress we have made and then we can quickly re-plan and be responsive to what a customer needs.

### <ins>Agile manifesto</ins>
- We have come to value:

    - **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
    - **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
    - **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
    - **Responding to change** over folowing a plan

> While there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more. 
> 
> It does not mean we do not have processing tools, it just means that we value interacting amongst ourselves and with our customers more than the process and tools.
>
> It does not mean we do not document (it is important so that people understand how to use the product), but we can not ship documentation.
>
> Working software is what we are here to deliver. It does not mean that we don't negotiate contracts, we still have contracts, but we want to collaborate with the customer.
>
> As things change, we want to be responsive, which does not mean that we do not have plans, but we value responding to change over simply following the plan.

### <ins>Agile software development</ins>
- Is an interative approach to software development consistent with the Agile Manifesto.

- Emphasizes flexibility, interactivity (with peers and customer) and a high level of transparency, so that everybody knows what everyone else is working on and feels responsible for delivering value to the customers.

- Uses small, co-located, cross-functional, self-organizing teams.

### <ins>Key takeway</ins>
- Build what is needed, not what is planned. If you build what was planned and the customer does not like it, why bother? It is important to make sure that as they need change, you want to build what is needed from the customer regardless of what was planned. We can always replan and be responsive to change.
